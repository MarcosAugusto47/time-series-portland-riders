Predicting demand for a transportation public service is interesting for government institutions
and associated companies. The aim of this work was to apply ARIMA and ETS models for a
dataset of monthly count of riders for the Portland public transportation system, from January
1960 through June 1969 . The results evidence that ETS models did not satistfy the residuals
quality criterions, but performed well in terms of prediction. Also the ARIMA model with
Box-Cox transformation was considered adequate after the residuals diagnostics, but had a poor
prediction performance when compared to the ETS models.
